## TODO

There are some tasks to be done:

1. Type inference
2. Modules aka packages, declarations and imports
3. Standard library:
   3.1. Aliases for build-in types to the target language ones (or just target language types)
   3.2. Collections (with generics)
   3.3. Nullable wrapper
4. ~~If-then-else~~
5. Foreach
6. Taint markers: ~~Detect~~, a way to put a taint mark, a way to remove it 
7. ~~C# external declaration~~
8. Generics
9. This
10. Function calls (with receiver)
11. Annotations
12. Macros for standard library
13. Move some semantic analysis from BE to FE
14. Add usings to the generated code
15. Types: api for basic target types and references
16. Checkers:
   16.1. Variable visibility
   16.2. Type checker
   16.3. Assignment to arguments
   16.4. Unresolved variable, field, function, argument, ...
17. Empty lines in the generated code
18. Compile-time constants (especially for strings) to use them instead of enums
19. Inheritance :(
20. Attributes aka object fields
